Documentation Report: Tkinter-Based Quiz Application


Project Overview
This project involves the development of a quiz application using Python and the Tkinter GUI framework. The application presents a series of questions to the user, allowing them to select answers from given options. The user's score is updated based on their answers.

Technical Stack


Programming Language: Python
GUI Framework: Tkinter


Classes and Key Components
1. Question Class
Description
Represents a single quiz question.
Attributes:
question: A string containing the question text.
options: A list of possible answers.
correct_answer: The correct answer to the question.


2. QuizApplication Class
Description
Manages the overall quiz application.
Attributes:
root: The main Tkinter window.
questions: A list of Question objects.
current_question: Index of the current question being displayed.
score: The user's current score.
correct_answers: Number of correctly answered questions.


Key Methods
setup_ui(): Sets up the user interface.
create_questions(): Initializes the list of questions.
display_question(question): Displays the current question and its options.
next_question(): Loads the next question or ends the quiz.
check_answer(): Checks the selected answer and updates the score.


User Interface
The application features a simple and intuitive interface with a question display area, multiple-choice buttons for answers, and a score display.
Methodology

Initialization: On application start, the main function creates a Tkinter window and an instance of QuizApplication.
Question Loading: The create_questions method initializes a set of predefined questions.
UI Setup: The setup_ui method creates UI elements like the question label, option buttons, and score label.

Quiz Progression: The user interacts with the application by selecting answers. The check_answer method validates the responses, updates the score, and calls next_question to proceed.
Completion: Once all questions are answered, the application displays the final score and ends the quiz.

Conclusion
This Tkinter-based quiz application demonstrates a straightforward implementation of a GUI application in Python. It showcases basic principles of GUI design, event handling, and object-oriented programming.
